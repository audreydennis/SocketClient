"Was I out of my head?
 Was I out of my mind?
 How could I have ever been so blind?
 I was waiting for an invitation, but it was hard to find.
 Don't matter what I say only what I do, I never mean to do bad things to you.
 So quiet but I finally woke up, If you're sad then its time you spoke up too..."
